", " The accident occurred June 23 on Route 403 between Davidsville and Tire Hill when a 2004 Pontiac Grand Am driven by Jason Himebaugh, 36, was hit by a 60-foot tree that fell onto the roadway. The car careened and struck a utility pole, authorities said.  ", " Dry rot caused the massive tree to fall, killing two sisters, 8-year-old Ryleigh Freiwald and 6-year-old Mikayla Freiwald, said Conemaugh Township Police.  ", " The girls' mother, Ashley Lichty, 26, and their sisters, Ciara Freiwald, 5, and Lillie Freiwald, 3, were injured but survived the crash. Lichty was eight months pregnant at the time; her unborn child also survived.   ", " The property owner now lives in Florida. His brother, Adam Thomas, oversaw the tree removal project.  ", " Initially there was some confusion about whether the tree that fell along the township-maintained road was on public or private property, but a PennDOT spokeswoman said the agency had no involvement with the recent tree removal. ", " Thomas hired Davey's Tree Services to remove the dying trees. ", " A neighbor of the property, Sandy Seth, said it took work crews two or three days to complete the job. She believes the tree removal will improve safety for drivers who travel Route 403. ", " \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe first time I drove down that road, all I saw was those trees,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Seth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey cut pretty far back from the road, so I think it will make a big difference.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  ", " Within 24 hours of the accident, a gofundme account generated $10,370, surpassing the $10,000 the family needed to cover funeral expenses for the two girls' funerals and medical expenses for their mother, sisters and Himebaugh, according to the website. In the weeks after, more than $12,000 was raised for the victims' family through the online donation page Jamie's Dream Team. Donations to the fund can be made at ", "http://jamiedreamteam.myfastsite.net/donate/", ".  ", " No lawsuits regarding the accident have been filed to date.
