 Alice Braga and the cast of “Queen of the South,” which films in downtown Dallas this week (USA Network)
Last week city officials acknowledged that, yeah, maybe they didn’t do the most bang-up job when it came to directing traffic during the 11/22/63 shoot in Dealey Plaza — especially on the first day of filming, when a traffic snarl extended from the West End to the east side during morning rush hour. But by week’s end, everything was fine, cops were on every downtown corner, and now everyone wishes James Franco was still in town, because, sure, why not. But fret not: There’s still another production in town, and it too wants to tie up downtown traffic this week beginning tomorrow.

That would be Queen of the South, the made-for-USA Network redo of the Telemundo hit based on the best-selling novel getting $150,000 worth of incentives from 1500 Marilla to shoot here. And, no doubt, there will be a lot of shooting: The series is about an on-the-run drug-runner’s girlfriend (played by Brazilian movie star Alice Braga, co-star of Elysium, I Am Legend and City of God) who hightails it from Mexico to Dallas after her lover’s murdered. By all accounts, she winds up being the head of the cartel.

Anyway. Dallas City Hall sends word that tomorrow and Wednesday, traffic will be “held on a temporary basis near the Reunion green space to accommodate filming” of Queen of the South.

According to a memo sent to the council Friday night, “Portions of the following streets will be impacted for short periods of time on both days: Reunion Boulevard, Market Street, Houston Street, Record Street, Jackson Street, Wood Street and Young Street.” Word is they’ll be filming in and around Ferris Plaza and The Dallas Morning News. So that’ll be fun.

And in case you’re concerned, and I don’t know why you would be, First Assistant City Manager Ryan Evans tells the mayor and council that “a comprehensive traffic plan has been developed by the Dallas Police Department in conjunction with the series production company in an effort to minimize traffic interruptions.”
