 Another man who is not an officer was also wounded at the scene, but there was no word on his injuries or condition.

Ontario's Special Investigations Unit, a separate body that looks into all cases of serious injury, sexual assault or death involving police officers, has taken over the investigation.

It said in a brief statement that the two officers were responding to an address on Canboro Rd. in Pelham at around 8 p.m. ET on Saturday when they found a man at the location. 

"The man and two police officers suffered gunshot wounds and were taken to hospital," the statement says.

On Saturday, McGuire issued a statement via Twitter thanking people "for their thoughts and prayers." Niagara Regional Police is the force that is responsible for policing Ontario's Niagara peninsula.
