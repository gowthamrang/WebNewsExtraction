Police said an off-duty state corrections officer shot and killed an armed robber who brandished a gun at him and four other men in Queens on Saturday. The New York Daily News reports the would-be thief demanded they give him the keys to their motorcycles.

A scuffle ensued, an NYPD spokesman told the Daily News, and the officer shot the 35-year-old man in the head. The incident took place on Rockaway Boulevard, near 95th Avenue.

The man was in cardiac arrest when EMS workers arrived. He died later, at Jamaica hospital.

Police found what they believe is the dead manâ€™s gun at the scene.
