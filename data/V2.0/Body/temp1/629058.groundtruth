 Two Pickens County deputies â€“ both shot during a domestic dispute call that left one man dead — are recovering at home Sunday morning.

According to Channel 2 Action News, at around 9 p.m. Saturday night, the deputies responded to a domestic incident in the 1600 block of Carver Mill Road near the town of Talking Rock.

The sheriff’s office said a suspect opened fire on the deputies responding to the call. One officer was hit in the elbow and the other was shot in the back. He was wearing a bulletproof vest.

The deputies called in Georgia State Patrol and two troopers arrived within minutes.

GSP said they encountered an armed man and got into a standoff with the suspect, ordering him to put down his gun.

“At some point the subject fired at officers,â€ GSP spokesman Tim Nichols said. â€œOfficers on scene along with troopers on scene returned fire and the subject is deceased.â€

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation will handle the investigation and perform the autopsy on the suspect, who was shot and killed by officers.

Pickens County Sheriff Donny Craig confirmed to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Sunday morning that the deputies had been released from the hospital.

Pickens County is about 60 miles north of Atlanta.
