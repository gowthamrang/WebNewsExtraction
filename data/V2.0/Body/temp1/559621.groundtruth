 From the master of mayhem Ken Ludwig, The Game’s Afoot is a decadent, deadly and delicious, comedy thriller – a glittering whodunit filled with twists, turns and murderous pandemonium.

The Mad Cow herd, which is based in Shrewsbury and has members from across Shropshire and Mid Wales, is performing the show at Shrewsbury’s Theatre Severn. The play tells the tale of Broadway star William Gillette, who has been admired the world over for his leading role in the play Sherlock Holmes, and who has invited his fellow cast-members to his home for a weekend of revelry but finds himself turning detective when one of his guests is murdered.

The play will run until Saturday at 7.30pm, with a matinee performance on Saturday at 2.30pm.
