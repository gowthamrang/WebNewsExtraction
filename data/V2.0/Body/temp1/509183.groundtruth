â€œIt is imperative that we support our local communities by supplying them with the tools they need to best protect their citizens,â€ Carter said.

The COPS grants are awarded to local law enforcement agencies to fund new officers to help with community crime prevention efforts.

â€œThis COPS grant will fund 13 new police officers and allow Killeen Police Department to elevate its policing efforts and better align its resources to meet community needs and expectations,â€ said police Chief Dennis Baldwin.

â€œCOPS grants have provided tremendous benefit to our department and community, and this allocation will further aid our public safety mission.â€

A total of $113 million was awarded to 209 agencies during the 2015 grant cycle, Carter said.

The Killeen Police Department received a $1.8 million COPS grant in 2010 for 10 officers and another $1.5 million in 2014 for 13 officers.
