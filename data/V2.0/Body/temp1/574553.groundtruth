 A Sulphur woman who was driving the wrong way on Interstate 210 on Thursday evening died after crashing head on into another vehicle, authorities said.
Dene Barthels, 79, was driving east on I-210 West just after 7 p.m., according to Lake Charles police Deputy Chief Mark Kraus. Barthels crashed into a car near the Lake Street overpass.

Barthels was taken to St. Patrick Hospital, where she was pronounced dead, Kraus said. The driver of the other vehicle was taken to an area hospital and is listed in critical but stable condition.

Kraus said Barthels used the Nelson Road exit ramp to enter the interstate. He said a car traveling west on the interstate avoided hitting Barthelsâ€™ car and steered into the guardrail at Contraband Bayou. After the collision, Kraus said a pickup truck was also involved in the crash.

Toxicology reports on all drivers are pending.
