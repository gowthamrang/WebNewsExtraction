 They chanted it in Grand Central Terminal, shouted it in Times Square, emblazoned it across Facebook and Twitter, the three words that came to stand for the death of another unarmed black man at the hands of a white police officer.

â€œI canâ€™t breathe,â€ Eric Garner had gasped after the officer put his neck in a chokehold on a hot July day on Staten Island, a fatal encounter captured on video and viewed by millions of people. On Wednesday, after a grand jury declined to indict the officer, the words â€” and the video â€” were revived in a wave of despair and fury that rolled as far out as the corridors of Capitol Hill and the streets of Oakland, Calif.

Elected officials in New York and Washington, too, did not hold back, offering an extraordinary outpouring of stunned reaction that seemed to mirror â€” and perhaps calm â€” protestersâ€™ anger. As demonstrators rushed to Staten Island, hundreds of people marched north from Times Square, trying, and failing, to push through police barricades to disrupt the annual Christmas tree lighting at Rockefeller Center. Protesting from midafternoon to late into the night, they blocked traffic on the West Side Highway, disrupted it on the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge and at the Lincoln Tunnel, sat en masse at Columbus Circle, and held â€œdie-insâ€ at Grand Central Terminal and near Radio City Music Hall. â€œWe canâ€™t breathe,â€ they chanted. Unlike those in Ferguson, Mo., after a grand jury decided not to indict a police officer in the death of an unarmed black teenager there, the protests remained largely peaceful, with about 30 arrests by 10 p.m. Early Thursday morning, several groups of protesters continued to march through the city, with many demonstrating at the Brooklyn Bridge and some remaining in Times Square.

Yet this was no Ferguson, where conflicting witness accounts obscured the circumstances of the confrontation between Michael Brown and Darren Wilson, the white officer who shot him. This encounter was recorded at close range on a cellphone camera, the fact that kept many on Wednesday asking: How? Why? â€œThey keep on showing the tape on TV, over and over and over,â€ she said. The officer, Daniel Pantaleo, had been trying to arrest Mr. Garner for selling loose cigarettes. â€œI mean, over a cigarette?â€

What could you say, people asked, when the evidence could not seem clearer. What conclusion could you draw, other than:

â€œIt looks like thereâ€™s no change,â€ said Jesse Love, who was one of a few dozen protesters who gathered at the scene of Mr. Garnerâ€™s death, outside a beauty supply store and opposite a humble park. No change in police behavior, in the way African-Americans are treated by the legal system, in race relations. Nearby, Daniel Skelton, 40, ripped cigarettes from a pack of Newports, flung them to the ground and stomped on them.

â€œBlack lives,â€ he shouted.

In Oakland, a diverse crowd of about 200 marched. â€œThereâ€™s this big talk about the body cameras, and here we have this officer killing Eric Garner on camera, and he still gets away with it,â€ said Ashlee Johnson, 26.

Reacting swiftly, President Obama said the decision not to indict the officer underscored the frustrations that many African-Americans felt about their treatment by a legal system they believed was stacked against them.
