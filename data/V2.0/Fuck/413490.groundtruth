 (CBS) — A mother in Kenosha, Wisconsin is due in court today charged in the murders of her two children.

Lucia Hernandez-Alvarez, 34, was released from a hospital Sunday and is now in jail, accused of killing her one and three year old kids.

The father of the children found their bodies early Saturday and his wife with cuts to her arm.

Police say she kept detailed notes about force feeding medicine to the children. Detectives say the mother and father were having relationship problems. Relatives and neighbors gathered for a vigil outside the family home in Kenosha Sunday night. They grieved the deaths of Alicia and Javier Hernandez.

The exact cause of death for the children could be released as early as today. The children’s father was among those attending the vigil.
