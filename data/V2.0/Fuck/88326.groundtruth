 SYDNEY, Australia â€” Heavily armed police officers ended a hostage siege in Sydney early Tuesday, storming a downtown cafe where an armed man had held employees and customers for more than 16 hours.

The captor and two hostages died during the confrontation and four other people were wounded, the New South Wales Police said Tuesday morning.

Live television images of the scene showed intense flashes of gunfire and loud concussions from stun grenades as police officers raced into the building at about 2:10 a.m. local time with weapons drawn, followed later by medics with stretchers.

Andrew Scipione, the New South Wales police commissioner, said the police moved quickly to enter the cafe after gunshots were heard inside. â€œThey made the call because they believed that at that time, that if they didnâ€™t enter, there would have been many more lives lost,â€ he said. Before the gunshots were heard, he said, the police believed that no one in the cafe had been injured. Just before the police entered the building, at least six hostages were seen running from the cafe. The police said later that there had been 17 hostages in all. The police statement reporting the deaths identified the hostage taker as â€œa 50-year-old manâ€ but did not give his name. Mr. Scipione referred to the man as a â€œlone gunmanâ€ in his remarks at a news conference on Tuesday.

Earlier, the police confirmed reports that the hostage-taker was Man Haron Monis, an Iranian-born man around 50 with a criminal record who called himself Sheikh Haron.

The hostages who died were a 34-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman, the police said. One of the injured people was a police officer, who was treated for an injury to the face and was in good condition, the police said.

Mr. Monisâ€™s former lawyer, Manny Conditsis, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in a televised interview before the siege ended that he believed Mr. Monis was acting alone. â€œHis ideology is just so strong and so powerful that it clouds his vision for common sense and objectiveness,â€ Mr. Conditsis said, calling his former client â€œa damaged-goods individual who has done something outrageous.â€

Even so, it remained unclear whether Mr. Monis had any accomplices. The armed man took control of the Lindt Chocolate Cafe on Martin Place in central Sydney around 9:45 a.m. Monday, trapping employees and customers inside. He had a black flag with white Arabic script, similar to those used by Islamic militants on other continents, which was later displayed in a cafe window.

During the day Monday, five people fled the cafe, including two employees, but it was not clear whether the assailant had allowed them to leave or they had escaped.

Auto and rail traffic was halted and nearby buildings like the New South Wales Parliament and the Reserve Bank were evacuated or locked down, and helicopters circled overhead. Police officials said they made contact with the hostage-taker and tried to negotiate an end to the siege.

Mr. Monis was known to the police. According to The Sydney Morning Herald, he was free on bail in two separate criminal cases. He was charged in November 2013 with being an accessory before and after the fact in the murder of his ex-wife, Noleen Hayson Pal, and in April 2014, he was charged with the indecent and sexual assault of a woman in western Sydney in 2002. Forty more counts of indecent or sexual assault relating to six other women were later added in that case.

Mr. Monis pleaded guilty in 2013 to 12 charges related to the sending of poison-pen letters to the families of Australian servicemen who were killed overseas, local media reports said. He was reportedly sentenced to probation and community service.
