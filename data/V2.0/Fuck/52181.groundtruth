 Neighbors of a grandfather who was shot and killed by sheriff's deputies held a peace march Sunday to remember the man who family members said was fixing a bicycle shortly before the shooting.
Johnny Ray Anderson, 43, who was also a grandfather to three children and a father of seven, was killed on the night of July 5 in Hawaiian Gardens when authorities responded to calls of a prowler possibly knocking on doors. Chanting, carrying signs and blowing whistles, the group marched Hawaiian Gardens Public Safety Center, where they were met by the city's mayor.
"This officer needs to put behind jail just like anybody else that kills people," said Anderson's sister, Francine Travino, at the rally. Anderson's wife, Kathleen Anderson, said she and her husband had been squatting in the abandoned home behind the yard where the fatal shooting happened, and that he jumped the fence into the yard because he didn't want deputies to see him.
Residents at the home reported a man was knocking on their door trying to get inside. Hawaiian Gardens is under gang injunction, and relatives told NBC4 News that may have been why Anderson ran, as he has been in trouble with the law before.
Anderson was shot once in his upper body. Kathleen Anderson said he had been fixing a bicycle shortly before the shooting and that he did not have a weapon on him at the time of the incident.
The family's attorney said the deputy who shot Anderson has been placed on desk duty.
