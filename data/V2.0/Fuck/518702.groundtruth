The officer, whose name has not been divulged publicly, made a U-turn at approximately 9:30 p.m. July 22 on Eight Mile Road, between Interstate 94 and Beaconsfield Road, to pull over a motorist, police said at the time.

James Bush, 20, was riding a Harley Davidson motorcycle and collided with the police vehicle.

Bush, who resided in the city and was a captain of the 2012-13 Lake Shore High School football team, was transported to a hospital. Approximately 45 minutes later, doctors declared him dead.

St. Clair Shores police officials contacted the Michigan State Police to conduct the investigation.

The resulting findings by the State Police Special Investigation Section were turned over to the Wayne County Prosecutor�s Office about three or four weeks ago, State Police Lt. Michael Shaw said Wednesday.

�We let them decide which �- if any �- criminal charges will be filed,� Shaw told The Macomb Daily. He declined to release other details of the incident beyond the extent of the preliminary information provided by St. Clair Shores police to the media on the night of the crash.

Among the information not yet revealed: the directions the officer and Bush were heading seconds before the patrolman�s U-turn.

The results of the investigation were submitted to the Wayne County Prosecutor because the collision occurred on the Harper Woods side of Eight Mile Road.

The St. Clair Shores officer remains on paid administrative leave, Deputy Chief Steve Lambert said Thursday. Such leave is a common procedure whenever a police officer is involved in an incident that results in death or the use of lethal force.

As a courtesy, Michigan State Police provided to St. Clair Shores police officials a copy of the formal crash report plus additional information submitted to prosecutors, Lambert said.

The deputy chief said city police will not disclose details until prosecutors reach a conclusion and notify both agencies.

�They know this officer is off on administrative leave. He and our department are anxious for some sort of answer from them. They promised us they would move on it as quickly as possible,� Lambert added.

The findings delivered to prosecutors were expected to include the autopsy report of Bush and results of toxicology tests to the Macomb County Prosecutor�s Office.

Whatever the outcome in the government setting, the city�s police force feels the incident remains tragic for everyone involved, Lambert said.

�They�re supporting their fellow member knowing what it all entails. Obviously the police department has to move on, day in and day out. There are calls that have to be answered. We can�t dwell for too long on what happened,� said the deputy chief, noting that officers continue to sympathize for Bush�s family and feel their grief.

At a meeting of the MAC football coaches with reporters in July, Lake Shore head football coach Tom Iwanicki thanked his colleagues for their thoughts and best wishes following the tragedy.
