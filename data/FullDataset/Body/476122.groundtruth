 WEST PALM BEACH (CBS12) -- A new Quinnipiac Poll is out Thursday morning. There are four names you should watch; one of them belongs to a person who isn't even in the race.

On the Republican side Donald Trump is running the field. He's got 28-percent of Republican support. He's followed by retired neurosurgeon, Dr. Ben Carson at 12-percent. 

No other GOP candidate breaks double-digits.  Hillary Clinton still leads the Democrats. She's still got 45-percent of democratic support nationally.      

That's down from 55% a month ago.
