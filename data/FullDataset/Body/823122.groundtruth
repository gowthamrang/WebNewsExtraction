 Wheeler was killed in line of Duty in October.

Wheeler was born in Roland and grew up in Muldrow. Wheeler's family still lives in the area, so they will get together to remember his accomplishments, including his 11 bronze star medals.

Wheeler, along with others, helped rescue 70 hostages in Iraq while exchanging gunfire with ISIL militants. Wheeler was killed in the line of duty and has since been honored with the Purple Heart following his death.

Earlier this month, a ceremony was held in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. There were over 1,500 people who came to show their respects to Wheeler. Later a private ceremony for his family was held at Arlington National Cemetery, where Wheeler was laid to rest.

The ceremony at Trinity United Methodist Church in Muldrow begins at 10 a.m.
