It was usually numbered, usually a random collection of thoughts about Florida football, and usually written by the skin of my teeth on Monday morning in between a thousand other things.

This past season it didn't appear here. This was, unlike a lot of decisions on EDSBS, a deliberate thing. Sometime around July, when I was in Myanmar, it came back. It came back slow and just followed me around like a wet dog and no amount of travel or listening to Earth Wind and Fire would shake it.  In retrospect, it was overdue. For most of my life, starting at around age 12 and returning every five or six years or so, I'd get the sustained feeling that all I wanted to do was lay down and sleep and not let stupid words come out of my mouth or my fingers.

I'm very lucky in that. Depression can be and is a lot, lot worse for other people. Most of the time I work through it. At worst I'm like myself, but on power-saving mode: dimmer, slower, and without the full range of normal features. Some people can't drag themselves out of bed, much less type or work or be a part of their family. I still get a lot of the prime features, though. Nothing tastes as good as it should, nothing that comes out of your mouth feels like something said by a real, caring human. Words feel like they turn to ash in your mouth, and die on the screen.  You live as an imitation of yourself, like the American version of a much better English show.

So if I didn't write about Florida football at all this fall, it's not because Florida football is to depressing to write about. It's because I was too depressed to write about something I enjoy, and didn't want to fuck up whatever they were doing with my stupid-ass self. For the record, they were great, and so much better than anyone thought they could be even after Will Grier got suspended for beefcaking his way into non-slim jeans with workout supplements. That even includes the last three blowouts at the hands of much better teams. Even then, they were great and tried hard and and not writing about them made it so much easier to just relax, laugh, and enjoy watching a coaching staff juggle moving parts for as long as they could until they dropped on the floor with the Grier suspension and subsequent collapse.

The Tennessee game remains one of the funniest finales to a long series of extremely cruel and satisfying endings to games in that series, and that is saying something.
