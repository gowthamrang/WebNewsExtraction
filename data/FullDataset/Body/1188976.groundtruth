 DRESDEN | A Whitehall woman was charged with driving while intoxicated after a crash Monday night on Route 22, police said.

Samantha A. Woods, 21, was arrested after State Police responded to a 7:34 p.m. call about a disabled vehicle that had hit guidewires on the highway, officials said. Officers arrived to find no one with the car, but determined who had been driving and located her, according to State Police.

She told police she swerved to avoid a fox in the road, and crossed the oncoming lane and went off the travelled lane.

Wood was found to have a blood alcohol content of 0.08 percent, which is the threshold for intoxication, according to State Police.

Woods was charged with misdemeanor DWI and issued traffic tickets for leaving the scene of a property damage accident and failure to keep right, police records show. She was released pending prosecution in Dresden Town Court.
