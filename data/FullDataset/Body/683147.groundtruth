 So things have already gone left between Love & Hip Hop: Hollywoodâ€™s highly touted gay couple. Miles Brock was arrested for beating up his former boo, Milan Christopher, on Halloween.

This is an awkward, but not surprising, development Christopher posted a long message on Instagram about at the drama, and deep emotional pain he experienced from filming the Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood reunion in New York. He’ll probably be sub-tweeting more about this situation in the days to come.

Itâ€™s interesting that this storyline evolved from a discussion on homosexuality in rapÂ to a messy breakup, and a physical altercation.

The last part actually sounds kind ofÂ familiar.
