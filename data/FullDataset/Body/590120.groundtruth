Original story

Emergency responders are continuingÂ efforts to rescue a boy and his dogÂ trappedÂ in a well along Gene TrailÂ in Lincoln County. Responders say the well's openingÂ appears to be too narrow for immediate access.

Lincoln County Sheriff Steve Rushing said the 4-year-old does not know how to attach the rope emergency personnel are attempting to use forÂ a rescue.

More units are en route from Hattiesburg with additional rescue equipment, said Rushing.

The child remains alert and is talking to emergency workers.
