 Studio Trigger announced on Friday that it animated a "BATTLE SAURS Opening Animation" short that is featured on the Blu-ray Disc home video release of Disney and Pixar's "Toy Story That Time Forgot" CG short.

Disney and Pixar's promo video for the home video release shows a few seconds of Trigger's extra (at 00:37 in the below video). Trigger's extra is a 2D animated opening sequence for the fake 80s anime-style "Battle Saurs" TV series that is featured in Disney and Pixar's short. Hiroyuki Imaishi (Gurren Lagann, Kill la Kill director) served as the opening animation character designer and animation director. He is also credited with the key animation drawings alongside Yoh Yoshinari (Little Witch Academia director) and Akira Amemiya (Inferno Cop series director). YÅ«ji Kaneko (Kill la Kill, Little Witch Academia) served as the art director, Eiji Tsuchida (Welcome to THE SPACE SHOW) handled the photography, Nahoko Kosugi (Doraemon animation director) and Yoshie Endo (Doraemon animation director) served as the in-between animation directors, and Hiromi Wakabayashi (Gurren Lagann setting production) was the animation producer and color designer.

Trigger also posted a set of thumbnailed screenshots from its opening animation short.



The home video release of "Toy Story That Time Forgot" CG short shipped in North America on November 3. The short originally aired as a special on ABC in December 2014.
