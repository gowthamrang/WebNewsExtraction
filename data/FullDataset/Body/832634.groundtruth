 GILBERT, Ariz. (KSAZ) - An inmate tried to escape while riding in the back of a police van on I-10 on Wednesday.

The Arizona Department of Public Safety tells Fox 10 that the inmate kicked out the back door of a Gilbert police van while it was traveling on the westbound lanes of I-10 near Elliot Road. The inmate got out of the moving van, but was injured during his attempted escape.

He is not back in police custody.

Due to the incident, several traffic lanes are blocked by police and there is a severe backup on I-10.

The Arizona Department of Transportation says traffic is backed up for about two miles and they recommend drivers take Loop 202 or 101 to avoid the backup.
