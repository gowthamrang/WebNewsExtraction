 A man in Vero Beach, Fla., died after 911 callers described him to be “tripping” and “acting crazy,” CBS 12 News reports.  

Authorities identified the man as Jermaine Benjamin, and they believe he died from a drug-related incident. The Indian County Sheriff’s Office received a 911 call close to 4 a.m. at a house on 35th Avenue, west of U.S. 1 and N. Gifford Road.  Calls had been made to this house at least 70 times, the Sheriff’s Office said.

Deputies attempted to give the Benjamin CPR, but he died at the hospital.  “Recently we have seen an increase in the number of drug related calls for service,” said Sheriff Deryl Loar to CBS 12 News. “The potency and quantity of street drugs is often unknown to the user until it is too late. We have had too many young people lose their lives to drugs.”

Benjamin’s death is still under investigation. Anyone who knows more about the incident the Sheriff’s Office want you to call Treasure Coast Crime Stoppers at 800-273-TIPS. All callers will be anonymous and could receive a cash reward up to $1,000.
