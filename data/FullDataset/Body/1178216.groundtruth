 Jury selection is scheduled to begin in the capital murder trial of a man accused of killing four people in eastern Kansas in 2013.
Kyle Trevor Flack is charged with capital murder in Franklin County in the shooting deaths of Kaylie Smith Bailey and her 18-month-old daughter. He’s also charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Andrew A. Stout and Steven White.
Stout, White and Kaylie Bailey were found dead at Stout’s farm in Ottawa, about 50 miles southwest of Kansas City. Bailey’s daughter’s body was found a few days later in neighboring Osage County.
Flack has been in custody since shortly after the bodies were discovered.
The Kansas City Star reports (http://bit.ly/1SiXfqU) that jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday. Authorities say jury selection could take two weeks.
