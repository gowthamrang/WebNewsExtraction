 Vigilant Solutions is "one of the countryâ€™s largest brokers of vehicle surveillance technology" and they've got a great deal for Texas police forces: install our license-readers and we'll alert you every time someone with an overdue fine drives through your town. You pull them over and offer them a trip to jail or immediate payment, using our credit-card machines, for which we charge a 25% "fee" which goes straight into our pockets.

It's "revenue neutral" -- what could possibly go wrong?

Nothing you'll ever learn about, anyway: agencies that take the deal have to sign a contract with a "non-disparagement clause" that binds them never to discuss the company's failings. The company, meantime, gets to retain the town's license-plate data for as long as it's "commercially useful."

Oh, and sometimes Vigilant makes mistakes and sends the police after people with no outstanding fines.
