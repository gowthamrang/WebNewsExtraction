 He asked me for a cup of tea.

Thatâ€™s when I knew something was wrong.Â Tony never drank hot tea, or coffee for that matter.

I watched him try to bring the mug to his lips, and my concerns hit overdrive. His hands shook uncontrollably.Â He was breathing heavily. And as I looked more closely at my boyfriend, his face wasnâ€™t its usual healthy shade.

He hadnâ€™t been feeling well for a week â€“ one of those itâ€™s-the-flu-type sicknesses that we all muscle through. He was determined to go to work that morning. Heâ€™d already started his truck; it was warming up in the driveway.

Instead we went to the emergency room and our lives were turned upside down for months to come.

Iâ€™ll share that with you, but let me first just tell you something: Get a flu shot.

If you haven't already, go get a flu shot

We expected our day to be like any other. He'd be up before dawn and hit the road at 5 a.m. I'd head to the office later.

TonyÂ worked a physicalÂ job, lugging about 5,000 pounds of salt to businesses around the Valley each workday.

At 50, he was a healthy guy. He didn't drink or smoke. He knew it was bad for him so he just never did it. Tony's a rule follower that wayÂ â€” it's one of the things I love.

Another thing I love about him is that he's a complete homer. He's an Arizona native and is loyal to all things local, especially the sports teams.

But he'll watch nearly any game. He should've been home that night in time to watch the Sugar Bowl.

As it turned out, we didn't watch that bowl gameÂ or the national championship the following week. Someone would have to tellÂ him that Florida State won the title. By then he was Â fighting for his life atÂ Banner Thunderbird Medical Center in Glendale.

We never gotÂ flu shots

Tony was a rule follower, but he never got a fluÂ shot.

Iâ€™d never gotten a flu shot either, and I work right here at The Republic, where we annually write stories about the flu.

Already this season, there haveÂ been more than 300 confirmed influenza cases in Maricopa County. It'sÂ the tip of the iceberg. For every known case, thereâ€™s an estimated 80 more, said Dr. Rebecca Sunenshine, medical director of disease control at Maricopa County Department of Public Health.

The flu season willÂ kick into high gear any time now. It usually reachesÂ its peak in February.

An average of 24,000 people in the United States die from the flu every year, according toÂ Sunenshine.

But stats arenâ€™t human, are they?

His oxygen level was 60

It was Jan. 2, 2014 when I sent Tonyâ€™s daughter Summer a text message with his oxygen level from the emergency room.

â€œHoly crap,â€ was the response of Summer, a registered nurse.

â€œWhat is normal?â€ I texted.

â€œAbove 95.â€

And here Iâ€™d dropped him off and let him walk into the emergency room on his own while I parked the truck.

Things happen to the body when itâ€™s starved for oxygen. I question how he was able to even tell them his name when he walked in.

I could tell from staffâ€™s reaction, and the speed with which we were surrounded by doctors and nurses, that things were serious. His body was septic. His organs were beginning to shut down. 13 days on a vent I stood with Tonyâ€™s two grown children when a solemn-looking doctor came out of ICU.

â€œHeâ€™s a very sick man,â€ the doctor said, and told us we could briefly go back into the room to pray before they put him on a ventilator.

These are the things in life that you canâ€™t prepare for.Â I'd tellÂ you how the kids and I went back there and spoke to Tony. I imagine we gathered around his bed and told him we loved him,Â but the truth is that IÂ donâ€™t remember a thing. All three of us were in shock.

We regrouped and returned to the room after the intubation.Â While Iâ€™ve heard of people being placed on a vent, seeing the aftermath was horrifying.

I thought Tony would still be sedated, but his eyes were wideÂ and panicked. He tried to move his mouth but the tube was there.

Our efforts to soothe him didnâ€™t seem to work, but we held his hands and tried. Eventually, the sedatives took him under, and I was never more grateful.

â€œI hope that when you wake up you donâ€™t remember getting the vent. You fought it.â€

That was my journal entry on Jan. 3, the first of many. Beeps, PEEPS and days in ICU

At some point they confirmed it was H1N1, the flu.

Who can say for sure how he got it. Weâ€™d traveled to Ohio for Christmas, and Tony had a layover in Dallas, which was hard hit by the flu that year. His kids were convinced TonyÂ couldnâ€™t take the cold of northeastÂ Ohio.

Who can say for sure why I didnâ€™t get it. Only after being admitted to theÂ hospital did we protect ourselves. Anyone entering the room was required to wearÂ a mask and gown.

Days passed. I tried to work from the hospital or at odd hours when I could slip into the office. I was aware The Republic was writing about the particularly hard flu season strikingÂ otherwise healthy men. We were living it; jumping every time the monitor squawked.

The machine registered something called PEEPs.Â I donâ€™t readily recall what PEEP means, butÂ Tonyâ€™s werenâ€™t good for a long time. We needed it to improve so they could reduce the amount of work the vent was doing.

Each day on the vent was a day closer to having to decide if the vent tube in his mouth would need to be replaced by aÂ trach tube in his neck.

The damage to Tony's lungs wasn't the flu's only impact. The low oxygen levels had nearly shut down his kidneys. Soon they were rolling in the giant dialysis machine.Â I tried not to look as the blood flowed out of his body to be cleaned, tried not to panic as another machine honked whenÂ his blood pressure dropped and prayed that each technician knew exactly what they were doing and how much Tony could handle. Those nurses and doctors became our heroes as we awaited signs of improvement.

Finally, the daily X-rays showed his lungs beginning to clear. They weaned him off the ventilator, lessened the sedatives and eventuallyÂ Tony awoke.

In all, he spent 13 days on a ventilator.

The long recovery

â€œBe careful with him, heâ€™s a healthy young man, just weak,â€ a nurse, who was like a drill sergeant and among our favorites, told aides who wheeled Tony in his hospital bedÂ out of ICU.

He could barely get his hand to his face in those initial days off the vent. TheÂ flu hadn't been just a respiratory infection, it had compromised organs and two weeks in a hospital bed left him nearly unable to move.Â For the first few days, the guy who use to throw salt around needed help to lift a spoon.Â Therapists helped him slowly build strength to walk again. And we helped him piece together where he was and what had happened. He had no memory of walking into the emergency room.

We left the hospital two years ago Monday, 23 days after that tell-tale request for hotÂ tea.

On Super Bowl SundayÂ heÂ ditched his walker. He refused to go to his brother's party using it. From there, he'd walk around the block and get less winded each time. He was as eager as anyÂ 16-year-old when he slid behind the wheel of his truck again and cruised through the neighborhood.

The dialysis, therapy and frequent doctor visits continued a while longer. He returned to work in May.

We were married that August. Now we go together to get flu shots.
