 SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WWLP) – There was a political debate Thursday night among the candidates who want to be Springfield’s next mayor. The debate was held at the J.F. Kennedy School in Springfield.

The candidates who want to deprive Incumbent Mayor Domenic Sarno of re-election to a second four-year term, answered questions before a sparse crowd at the Kennedy School in Indian Orchard. Mayor Sarno did not participate in the debate.

Six names on Tuesday’s preliminary ballot will be reduced to two. The two top vote-getters will be on the November ballot.

22News Reporter Kait Walsh served as moderator and asked the questions.
