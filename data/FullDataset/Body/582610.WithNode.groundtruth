But the reason Vidal came up with those pansexual theories was so that he could tell the world he was not exclusively gay. It may be true, as Vidal frequently maintained, that “gay and straight” are “nonexistent categories,” but the point was to establish that although he lived with a man, and had sex only with men, he was not, and never could be, merely a “homosexual.” (Vidal told Amis that he had been reading D. H.

For years, he slammed practical criticism for what he called its “slow killing of the work through a close textual analysis.” Yet, in 1979, in an attack on another bugbear—the emphasis, beyond academe, on a writer’s personality—he enlisted the New Critics to his cause, and regretted that “these paladins of the word have long since faded away.” And his writing on America (the “national security state” at home, the empire abroad) was beholden to a dark, declinist view. In the age of the Pentagon Papers, Watergate, and the Iran-Contra affair, he looked canny. But when the facts changed he didn’t change his mind, because his mind had not been formed by facts to begin with. Vidal’s view of the world was the opposite of supple, and someone who says, “It always comes down to money,” is bound to be wrong at least some of the time.

He was suave and smooth. He amused without effort. He didn’t care what people thought—and he didn’t care who knew that he didn’t care what people thought. Wolcott consoled himself with picking out the “hilarious aperçus and asides” recounted in the book, as when Vidal challenged Mewshaw to name the three saddest words in the English language, and supplied the answer: Joyce Carol Oates. This is the image of Vidal that seems destined to endure: cartoonish, two-dimensional, other than human.
