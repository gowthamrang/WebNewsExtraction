 Mike Zimmer, Jeff Bankowski take different backgrounds to same mission: Efficiency, effectiveness LANSING - If thereâ€™s one fitting metaphor for the difference between Jeff Bankowski and Mike Zimmer, itâ€™s their government ID badges.

Bankowski, the 44-year-oldÂ former venture capitalist who heads Gov. Rick Snyderâ€™s internal audit team, has the clean, bright badge of a state government newbie.

Zimmer, the 58-year-oldÂ career bureaucrat who runs Snyderâ€™s main regulatory agency, carries the beaten, scratched and hardly legible badge of a man whoâ€™s traversed the Capitol Complex many a time.

Together, the two men are perhaps more directly responsible than anyone in Snyderâ€™s inner circle for making state government work better for its 10 millionÂ residents.Â Zimmer, director of the Department of Licensing & Regulatory Affairs, is working to trim the state's regulatory web and tap into employee ideas about making their jobs more efficient. Bankowski, head of the Office of Internal Audit, is finishing up a first-of-its-kind statewide risk assessment that will help state agencies prioritize which problems get fixed first.

And their badges illustrate what each bringsÂ to the table: Bankowskiâ€™s two decades tracking risk, loss and the bottom line in the competitive private sector; Zimmerâ€™s lifetime learning the value of relationships in Lansingâ€™s bureaucratic and political machines.

For two men who each shamelessly list Snyder as one of their personal heroes, they find themselves fortuitously matched today under an accountant-turned-governor who preaches the virtues of public-private partnerships.

"Both sectors play important roles and can learn from one another," Snyder spokeswoman Sara Wurfel said in an emailed statement. "That collaboration is key. Around the time Bankowski was getting his feet wet as a Chicago analyst for BP, Zimmer already had a decade on his resume as a Capitol staffer and was transitioning to the executive branch.

A Middleville native and Michigan State University graduate, Zimmer became a government man in the mid-1980sÂ as legislative aide and later chief of staff for Republican state Sen. Phil Arthurhultz. That was long before Arthurhultzâ€™sÂ recent criminal troubles, but Zimmer was around during a mini-scandal over the senatorâ€™s donation of campaign funds to a nonprofit established to build a museum for the senatorâ€™s personal lunchbox collection.

But Zimmer kept his reputation as a man of integrity even among members of the opposition party.

â€œHe was always a straightforward person to deal with who wanted to do the right thing,â€ said Kelly Keenan, who would later serve as Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholmâ€™s legal counsel. â€œHe didnâ€™t seem to have any agenda other than doing what was supposed to be done.â€

In 1996, Zimmer took the helm of Gov. John Englerâ€™s Office of Regulatory Reform and later the Bureau of Hearings. He spent the bulk of the Granholm administration and most of Snyderâ€™s first term as a deputy in the state licensing agency. â€œI think a â€” I donâ€™t use the term â€˜longâ€™ â€” a tenured position in state government,Â it certainly brings you a knowledge of the programs we administer," Zimmer said in a recent interview with the State Journal. "It brings you relationships with people up and down the food chain. It brings you experience on what approaches have worked before and what hasnâ€™t.â€

His inspirations: His grandfather, who raised six kids and still found time to be involved in his community; Kathy Wilbur, his old boss at the former Department of Consumer & Industry Services, who taught him empathy and focus; and Engler, who taught him to always remember even small things because they may someday be important.

Zimmer â€œunderstands that, in order to move any kind of organization or project forward, the best way to do that is to not only have peopleâ€™s buy-inÂ but to have people motivated to really want to make it succeed,â€ said Lisa Gigliotti, the state director of administrative law judges whoâ€™s known Zimmer since his Senate days. â€œItâ€™s not something so it just sounds warm and fuzzy; he really cares about that.â€

In December 2014, Zimmer was LARAâ€™s chief deputy director when Snyder put him in the directorâ€™s chair. Less than a month later, Snyderâ€™s budget director, John Roberts, plucked Bankowski from the presidency of the firm Capital for Merchants in Troy and named him Internal Audits director.

His tale: Hometown boy leaves for the big city, comes home to give back.

As Zimmer made the transition from the legislative to the executive branch, Bankowski climbed the ranks of the audit team at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. At the start of the Granholm administration, Bankowski â€” a University of Michigan grad â€” returned to his Wolverine State to manage a risk advisory program for KPMG in Detroit.

On the drive across I-94, Bankowski decided he â€œwanted to help, even in the smallest part possible, making our state better,â€ he told the State Journal last month.

That was 2003. Over the next dozen years, he held various top accounting posts for Teksid Aluminum in Southfield and then Asset Acceptance Capital Corp. in Warren before joining Capital for Merchants, where he worked for about two years before taking Robertsâ€™ call.

His inspirations: His railroad-worker father and stay-at-home-mom-turned-realtor mother, who â€œalways emphasized the importance of education and doing more,â€ and his wife, a pediatric critical care nurse, who teaches him daily about giving back. As a boss, Bankowski said heâ€™s â€œjust a coach with a great team.â€

Heâ€™s â€œa walk-around kind of guy,â€ said Sandy Streb, a 10-year veteran of Internal Audit. â€œHe checks in with lots of people and is very active in his engagement with others.â€

â€œHeâ€™s very much about the employee,â€ agreed Kristen Hudson, another on Bankowskiâ€™s staff.

Just by the questions he asks, â€œyou can see that he just brings kind of a fresh perspectiveâ€ to government work, said Cindy Klatt, Bankowskiâ€™s counterpart in Ohio state government. She was at the Capitol last month for a sharing-of-best-practices session with Bankowskiâ€™s team.

Bankowski said efficient effectiveness is a pretty universal goal, but there are contrasts between public and private work. In business, thereâ€™s a sole focus on a common goal, like net income, but governmentâ€™s missions are myriad and that creates internal competition for resources.

And, under the stern watch of lawmakers and the public, â€œthereâ€™s a culture sometimes of being very risk-averse,â€ he said. â€œThatâ€™s why weâ€™re pushing this, â€˜Itâ€™s OK to fail. Fail forward. If you fall seven times, make sure you get up eight.â€™â€ Over the past year, the two men have brought separate backgrounds to separate positions that ultimately have the same mission: Fix whatâ€™s broken in a $54 billionÂ organization divided into 18 departments with 18 missions.

Zimmer hopes to streamline many of theÂ nearly 200 state boards, commissions and committees, the bulk of them licensing bodies within LARA. And heâ€™s trying to rouse a shrinking state government workforce where many employees feel more optimistic than in years past but still beset by an administration and Legislature they deem unfriendly. Bankowskiâ€™s mountain to climb? Over the last four years, about a quarter of all problems identified by the Auditor General were repeated from previous audits because they hadnâ€™t been fixed the first time.

But both men said their work is abetted by a CPA governor who values data-driven decisions andÂ priorities set by dashboards. All administrations have pushed efficiency, Zimmer said, but Snyder has â€œaccelerated it and made it almost an expectation, not really an option.â€

Bankowski prefers the term â€œengagementâ€ to â€œaudit,â€ and said he approaches state agencies â€œwith the point of, â€˜Here are the opportunities for us to make the program better,â€™ rather than the mantra of weâ€™re here to cut the program or look for blame. No credit. No blame.â€

â€œSometimes, people donâ€™t like change,â€ Zimmer said. â€œYou have to create a culture, create momentum where change is OK: â€˜Youâ€™re not going to lose your job. Youâ€™re not going to be less valuable. You may be doing different things, but we have to move towards change.â€™â€

Gigliotti said Bankowski and Zimmer are perfectly matched for their tasks. She called Zimmer â€œa visionary,â€ but said Bankowski can help him see beyond the sometimes constraining rules of government.

â€œWhatâ€™s great about those two being together is (Zimmer) can learn some of the private sector methods of being able to adapt,â€ she said. â€œHeâ€™s not so trapped in that box of, â€˜Oh, we canâ€™t do that.â€™â€
