Antonio Olmeda, 57, is accused of firing two shots that missed two uniformed police on Dec. 2, 2011. The incident occurred in Jackson Heights, according to published reports.
He was arrested on Dec. 19, 2011, and officers found that he had a document of names of targets in his car of two attorneys and a federal judge. One attorney had formerly represented him.
In searching Olmedaâ€™s apartment, officers uncovered a number of guns, including a .223-caliber fully automatic rifle and a 9 mm fully automatic pistol.
Then on Sep. 6, 2012, officers did a search of his Yonkers locker, finding more weaponary, two sniper rifles with scopes, two machine guns and at least eight pistols, to name a few.
â€œAntonio Olmeda, a one-man armory, was a convicted felon in possession of a vast cache of deadly weapons,â€ said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in a statement. â€œHe violated federal law by possessing guns at all, and even had he not been a convicted felon, he violated federal law by failing to register certain of the weapons.â€
On Oct. 14, 2014, Olmeda pleaded guilty to six weapons charges, the release stated.
He is charged separately by the state, and is still facing charges, including two counts of attempted murder in the first degree, among others for his alleged attempted shooting of the cops.
â€œAs is alleged in the pending state prosecution of Olmeda for attempted murder, he was not merely a hoarder of weapons, he used them with deadly intentions, shooting at two uniformed police officers,â€ Bharara added. â€œHis sentence today reflects the seriousness of his crimes.â€
