 CHARLESTON, SC — Solicitor Scarlett Wilson announced that a Charleston County jury has found Valentino M. Hayward (DOB 04/07/1990) (aka Tino) guilty of murder for the 2013 killing of Deontre Miles.

The jury handed down their verdict on Tuesday after over a week of trial. Judge Deadra Jefferson sentenced Mr. Hayward to 38 years in prison. Wilson stated, “Valentino Hayward has been well-known to police and prosecutors over the years. We are happy to finally get him into prison where he belongs.”

According to Assistant Solicitors Benjamin Chad Simpson and Lauren Mulkey, who prosecuted the case, on December 11, 2013, Valentino Hayward arranged a meeting with the Victim. The defendant’s true intent was to rob the victim for money. What started as two prior acquaintances meeting quickly escalated and resulted in a cold-blooded murder where the Victim was shot once in the back, and killed immediately.

Assistant Solicitor Simpson stated, “Hayward carefully planned this meeting, even provided turn-by-turn directions to lure the Victim into the area. He then took various steps afterwards to cover up the crime, but his attempts were discovered by Charleston Police Department Detectives who thoroughly investigated the case. The jury was attentive throughout the six day trial and we are especially grateful for their patience and determination to find justice for Hayward.”
