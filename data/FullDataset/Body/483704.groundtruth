 As a first time director, nabbing stars like Kurt Russell, Richard Jenkins, Patrick Wilson, and Matthew Fox is something of a dream. Getting those actors to star in a horror-western movie about the hunt for a group of cannibals abducting settlers in the Old West is the dream of just one man: S. Craig Zahler. In the writer/director’s feature debut, Bone Tomahawk, that impossible cast and plot line is made a reality.

Russell stars as Sheriff Franklin Hunt, the law in the budding town of Bright Hope. When some of the townsfolk go missing, the good Sheriff rounds up a slip-shod posse to hunt down the flesh-eating marauders. This might all sound like B-movie glory, but based on the new trailer for the film, Zahler may have a cult classic on his hands, at the least. From the looks of it, he’s constructed a taught fright film set against a unique backdrop, with the promise of some pretty gruesome death scenes to boot. Of course, those bloody moments are only just hinted at in the preview, which you can watch below (via EW). When a group of cannibal savages kidnaps settlers from the small town of Bright Hope, an unlikely team of gunslingers, led by Sheriff Franklin Hunt, sets out to bring them home. But their enemy is more ruthless than anyone could have imagined, putting their mission – and survival itself – in serious jeopardy. This is a gritty action-packed thriller chronicling a terrifying rescue mission in the Old West.
