 Three people died by other people's hands in the Des Moines metro area this weekend.

Thatâ€™s a mercifully rare statement for our city, but no less disturbing.

Jose Lopez, 28, was shot to death near 13th Street and Jefferson Avenue late Friday.

Polk County prosecutors charged 17-year-old Josue Socop with first-degree murder. Police said theÂ two foughtÂ about a woman.

Gino Risola, 41, was shot multiple times in his home on Southeast Carefree Lane in Waukee Saturday afternoon. He died at a Des Moines hospital.

Police say Brendan McGuinness, a 41-year-old man who lived just a mile away, pulled the trigger. He, too, is charged with first-degree murder.

Waukee police believe it was the first homicide in the city of about 18,000 since 1977.

Think about that for a moment. Every man, woman and child living in that suburb aged 38 or younger lived their entire lives without knowing this kind of violent death in Waukee.

Early Sunday, gunfire erupted outside the Evolution Nightclub in unincorporated Polk County. Four people were shot.

Dashwan E. Smith, 20,Â died at a hospital. The shots followed a fight outside the club that had hosted a â€œsocial media party,â€ wrote Register reporter Kim Norvell.

Polk County sheriffâ€™s detectives sought witness statements from hundreds of people who scattered after the shots were fired.

Despite the grueling weekend, Des Moines and its suburbs are not violent places. Every murder makes the news here. In some cities, where homicides are much less rare, only those with spectacular circumstances crack the back pages or a few seconds of TV news airtime.

Still, even here, we are somewhat callous to homicides. We rarely think of all the lives that were changed forever by these killings. Each death radiates out like so many ripples in the pond.

Take the case involving Socop and Lopez.

That shotgun blast did more than just kill one man; it broke the heart of his family, his friends and lovers.

No amount of tears will wash away the rage and anguish brought on by this violentÂ death.

We live in Des Moines. We expect to die of old age, not gunshot wounds.

And how will this woman the two allegedly argued over feel knowing that she was the center of a deadly dispute? Thatâ€™s a burden difficult to imagine.

There is the neighborhood where Lopez was killed. It's a diverse section of the city, home to immigrants of many cultures.

MacKenzie Elmer, the Register's crime reporter, canvassed the neighborhood Monday, hoping to find witnesses or people who knew Lopez.Â A police reporter always wants to write more about slayingÂ victims than the way they died.

She metÂ an African immigrant family who was awakened by the gunshot that took Lopez's life. They barely spoke enough English to tell her they didn't want to talk about it. Another neighbor, an Asian family with a well-manicured lawn, didn't speak English at all.

Yet violent death had visited their neighborhood. And that is a language everyone understands. And donâ€™t forget the emergency responders â€”Â the police, paramedics, doctors and nurses.

Despite the efforts on social media and sometimes the news media to paint police as trigger-happy killers a sneeze away from committing brutality, police are people. Seeing a dead person is never easy, especially one taken by violence.

My friend Dan Dusenberry, the late Des Moines police officer, often talked about being haunted by the things he saw in his nearly 40 years as patrolman.

In his unpublished memoirs, â€œStories by a Dead Cop,â€ Dan wrote of his terrible memories of â€œall the savage things people do to each other.â€

Paramedics and emergency room doctors and nurses expect blood as a part of their job.

Yet even when the injury to the body is grave, they work to beat death. Three times this weekend, because of the violent acts of other people, they lost.

And what of Josue Socopâ€™s teachers at North High School? He was a junior there. Now he stands accused of murder.

I have friends who teach at North. One told me he felt like he failed Socop.

That's how he is. He has a tough exterior, but he loves his students the way parents love their children. Lots of teachers do. He isnâ€™t a failure. Iâ€™m sure none of his lessons involved using a shotgun to resolve a dispute. If Socop did what heâ€™s accused of doing, he alone bears the responsibility of taking a manâ€™s life.

And then there is Socopâ€™s family. No parents want to raise an alleged murderer. What went so wrong?

Register reporters reached out to the families of the victims and the accused wherever possible. So far, no one wanted to talk.

That's often to be expected. The wounds are fresh. The grief is heavy. And the legal process is just beginning.

But there is a cruel math to it all, isn't there? Again, take the killing of Lopez.

The average life span of a man in America is 76 years. Socop is accused of robbing Lopez of nearly a half century of his life.

And Socop himself is just 17. If heâ€™s convicted, he will be in prison for nearly six decades.

That's potentially 150 years of life destroyed in a single pull of a trigger.

So much waste. So much suffering. So many ripples.
