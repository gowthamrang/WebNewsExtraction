ASBURY PARK (AP) â€” Authorities say an off-duty police officer was involved in a shooting at the Jersey Shore that left a woman seriously injured.
The shooting occurred around 11:30 a.m. Tuesday on a street in Asbury Park. Witnesses reported hearing several shots, and officials said the wounded woman was taken to a hospital.
Further information about the officer involved in the shooting was not immediately available, and a possible motive has not been disclosed.
