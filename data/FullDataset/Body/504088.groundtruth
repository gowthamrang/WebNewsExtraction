 SAN MARCOS, Texas -- A teenager died from what police are calling a "chokehold" at a sleepover in Hays County Sunday.

Officers responded to a house in the 100 block ofÂ Farm House Road in the Blanco Vista Subdivision, where CPR was in progress on a victim. After investigating, the officers discovered that seven friendsÂ -- both male and female Hays High School students --Â were having a sleepover or hanging out at the house.

Two of the boys got into a game of wrestling, according to police.Â At some point, one boy got 17-year-old Elijah Hernandez into a chokeÂ hold and told him to tap out. Police saidÂ Hernandez did not tap out and passed out. That's when the kids realized that Hernandez was not breathing, his lips were turning blue and he was not responsive.

The group woke up the parents and the father immediately began CPR. Police and EMS responded, and Hernandez was taken to Seton Hospital in Kyle where he was pronounced dead.
