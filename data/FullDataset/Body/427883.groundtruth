 LEVERKUSEN, Germany (AP) - Javier “Chicharito” Hernandez scored his first goal for Bayer Leverkusen as the German side began its Champions League campaign Wednesday with a 4-1 home win over BATE Borisov in Group E.

Admir Mehmedi opened the scoring with the outside of his boot in the fourth minute, nine minutes before Serbian defender Nemanja Milunovic drew the visitors level with a deflected header.

Hakan Calhanoglu restored Leverkusen’s lead with another deflected goal two minutes after the break, and Hernandez struck in the 59th. The Mexico striker ran onto Kevin Kampl’s ball forward and fired through the BATE goalkeeper’s legs for his first goal since switching from Manchester United.

Calhanoglu rounded off the scoring with a penalty in the 76th.

Defending champion Barcelona drew 1-1 at Roma in the other Group E game.
