 A man was found shot to death early Friday morning slumped behind the steering wheel of a car parked at a strip center in southwest Houston.

The man was found at about 1:45 a.m. at 9800 Bissonnet near Country Creek, according to the Houston Police Department.

Police said the man had been shot more than once and bullet holes pockmarked the car. The driver's- side door window appeared shattered.

Investigators said they believe the man had been shot hours before his body was discovered. No one had apparently noticed him or the gunfire. His name has not been released.

So far, police have no motive or suspects in the case.Â
