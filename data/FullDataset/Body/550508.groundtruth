 Pressure has been building on police departments across the country, including those in Lancaster County, to make public the names of officers who use deadly force.

Now, Pennsylvania lawmakers are taking steps to allow police officers in those cases complete anonymity.

New legislation would allow the name of an officer to be withheld from the public in cases when force is used or a firearm is discharged. Only if the officer is criminally charged at the conclusion of an investigation would his or her name be released.

The bill, introduced by Republican Rep. Martina White of Philadelphia, has 54 cosponsors in both political parties â€” including three Republicans from Lancaster County â€” and remains in the stateâ€™s judiciary committee.

The issue of police officers' use of force has been in the forefront of media coverage since the events in August 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri, when officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. Wilson was later exonerated.

The issue arose in Lancaster County this summer with the May 19 shooting death of Anthony Gomez Jr., and Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedmanâ€™s decision not to release the names of the officers involved because of threats made against the officers.

Chief defends withholding name

In his more than seven years with the Lancaster Police, Chief Keith Sadler said it was the first time they did not release the name of an officer in a police-related fatal shooting. He was â€œamazedâ€ and â€œfrustratedâ€ to hear the criticism for not releasing the names in an effort to protect them and their families.

â€œWhen thereâ€™s a viable threat and the district attorney says, â€˜Iâ€™m not releasing the names of the officers,â€™ that should be good enough,â€ Sadler said. â€œItâ€™s a shame. There should be a level of transparency, but whenever thereâ€™s one extreme, you can count on another extreme to balance that out.â€

This summer, Philadelphia police initiated a policy in which they will release the names of officers involved in shootings after 72 hours if a threat has not been made against them or their family.

Manor Township Chief Todd Graeff said 72 hours â€œsounds like a reasonable amount of timeâ€ because there is often a â€œknee-jerk reactionâ€ after police-involved shootings.

â€œItâ€™s not by the chiefs of the departments, but by others outside who want to comment on it but donâ€™t know all the facts,â€ Graeff said.

However, Sadler said the threats against the Lancaster officers were received five days after the shooting, so a 72-hour policy would have been ineffective.

â€œIf we had that same policy in Lancaster with that shooting â€¦ It would have put those officers and their families in danger,â€ said Sadler, who spent 27 years as a Philadelphia police officer.

â€œWhen you lock yourself into a number [of hours to release an officerâ€™s name], that has a way of backfiring,â€ he said.

South Regional Chief of Police John Fiorill, who said he lobbied for the legislation in Harrisburg, said he commended Sadler and Stedman for protecting the identities of the officers involved in the Lancaster shooting.

Fiorill said police â€œwant to be open about everything we do,â€ but sometimes there is a concern for the officers and they deserve protection.

â€œAll it takes is one threat in todayâ€™s society for a police officer and his colleagues to be concerned about their safety,â€ Fiorill said.

Transparency jeopardized?

While threats against an officer would be a reason to protect his or her anonymity, others argue that it isnâ€™t a reason to have a rule across the board that jeopardizes transparency.

â€œWe as taxpayers give these people guns,â€ said Mary Catherine Roper, deputy legal director for the ACLU of Pennsylvania. â€œNot only guns but the power to use them. The public is entitled to know how the police are using the most serious power that can be given to any government official.â€

The public should have the opportunity to understand the actions of police officers and departments for the sake of accountability, said Paula Knudsen, director of government affairs/legislative counsel for the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association.

â€œOfficers' names should be disclosed in most circumstances, and law enforcement agencies should establish clear guidelines to enable meaningful access and public accountability,â€ Knudsen said.

State Rep. Keith Greiner, R-Leola, a cosponsor of the bill, said in an email he believes the legislation works to both protect officers and ensure transparency

â€œWith some of the recent events nationwide, there definitely appears to be hostility towards police officers and law enforcement officials,â€ Greiner said. â€œViolent criminals have even targeted police officers, simply because they are wearing the uniform.â€

State Reps. David Zimmerman, R-East Earl Township, and Mindy Fee, R-Manheim, are the only other two Lancaster County lawmakers currently backing the legislation.

Zimmerman said itâ€™s important that when an act is deemed criminal, the name should be readily available.
