The man told police the boys began yelling obscenities at him as he approached them while they rummaged through the bed of a parked truck, the New Orleans Police Department said in a statement.

The man said the older boy pulled a gun from his waistband and threatened to shoot him if he didn't leave the pair alone, according to police.

The boys were arrested after a tip from a witness, and booked into the Juvenile Division for aggravated assault and illegal possession of a firearm by a juvenile, police said.
