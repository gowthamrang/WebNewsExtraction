 GOSHEN, N.Y. (AP) â€” Police say a 55-year-old retired New York police chief fatally shot his former girlfriend before turning the gun on himself.

State troopers responded to a 911 call around 8:30 a.m. Saturday for shots fired in the Town of Goshen. They found 55-year-old Marie Giannone dead after being shot multiple times in the driver's seat of her car.

Authorities say her former boyfriend, Patrick Sorrentino, allegedly killed Giannone before turning the gun on himself. The retired deputy police chief with the City of Newburgh Police Department died of single self-inflicted gunshot wound. His body was found nearby.

Investigators say the two had dated for about 18 months and broke up in August. Authorities said in a news release that Sorrentino had become withdrawn and angry after the couple split up.

Newburgh police chief Daniel Cameron called the incident a "senseless act" and said Sorrentino retired in 2007.
