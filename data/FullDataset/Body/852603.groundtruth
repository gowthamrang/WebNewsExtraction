 ASHLANDâ€ˆâ€” Kentucky State Police detective posing as a 14-year-old girl in Morehead helped to catch an Ohio man allegedly looking for sex on an Internet advertising site, according to recently unsealed court records.
The man was arrested in October when he drove to Morehead to meet the girl, according to court documents. A federal grand jury indicted him Nov. 19 on a charge of traveling in interstate commerce for illicit sex with a minor.
An affidavit filed by FBIâ€ˆSpecial Agent Clay Hoover details the detectiveâ€™s steps in setting up an Internet text messaging account and posting an ad in the personals section of the Craigslist Internet advertising site.
Kentucky State Police Detective Brian Cooper, working with the Kentucky Internet Crimes Against Children program, set up the sting Sept. 29 with himself as bait posing as a 14-year-old girl named Kylee; he received a text message the same day from a Maineville, Ohio, man named Albert Trinh.
Trinh said in his text he was 19 and a student at the University of Kentucky. He confirmed he knew â€œKyleeâ€â€ˆwas 14 and asked to meet for sex.
In text exchanges sprinkled with teen-speak LOLs, Trinh arranged a meeting at what he thought would be the girlâ€™s home, actually an address provided by the Rowan County Sheriffâ€™s Department.
When Trinh showed up, he was arrested and confessed he drove to Morehead from Ohio for sex with the girl and he believed the girl was 14.
Trinh is free on bond, but is restricted to his home under electronic monitoring. Until his case is resolved, he is prohibited from using computers, cellphones, the Internet or cameras.
He is prohibited from contact with children.
