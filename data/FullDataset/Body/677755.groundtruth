 Four Chicago police officers were credited with saving the lives of two men trapped inside a burning car in the Gresham neighborhood early Sunday morning.
At about 2:20 a.m., the officers responded to reports of a car crash in the 7700 block of South Loomis after a driver who was speeding in the block struck several parked vehicles, according to police. Upon arrival, the officers saw that one of the vehicles was on fire, and witnesses told them they saw one person get out of the car but two others remained inside. The officers then broke out windows in car doors and pulled out two unconscious men before the car became completely engulfed in flames, according to police.
Three men were transported to area hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. None of the officers were injured.
