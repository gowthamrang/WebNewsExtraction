Carlson is a major developer in the area. But on June 14, 1985 he was an Army Reserves Lieutenant Colonel. And on that day he was taking a flight from Athens to Rome. The plane was hijacked about 10 minutes into the flight. "],["/html[1]/body[1]/div[4]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[3]/p[4]/text()[2]","The story made international news.  At one point the hijackers were demanding fuel and they said one American would die if their demands weren't met by a certain deadline.
