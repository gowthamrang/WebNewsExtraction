 The Justice Department said on Tuesday that there was insufficient evidence to pursue federal criminal civil rights charges against a former Milwaukee police officer in the death of an unarmed black man. The officer, Christopher Manney, was fired after fatally shooting Dontre Hamilton, 31, on April 30, 2014. â€œThe evidence was insufficient to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Manney acted willfully with a bad purpose to violate the law,â€ the Justice Department said. Mr. Hamilton, who was mentally disabled, was shot 14 times during a struggle in Red Arrow Park in downtown Milwaukee. Mr. Manney opened fire after Mr. Hamilton took his baton and hit him, according to the authorities. â€œMistake, misperception, negligence or poor judgment are not sufficient to establish a federal criminal civil rights violation,â€ the Justice Department said. Police Chief Edward Flynn fired Mr. Manney in October 2014, saying he had failed to follow police policies when addressing mentally ill people.
