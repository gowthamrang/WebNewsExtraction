 BURTONSVILLE, Md. (AP) â€” Police say two men have been arrested and charged with killing a man in a park in Burtonsville earlier this month.

Montgomery County police say 24-year-old Earl Bennette and 22-year-old Shante Gladden were arrested Friday. Both are charged with first-degree murder and armed robbery in the fatal shooting of 22-year-old Garrett McClees on October 8.

McClees was slain in the Edgewood Neighborhood Park. His backpack was stolen. Police say McClees knew the assailants, and the slaying is believed to have been drug-related.

Gladden was arrested in the District of Columbia, while Bennette was arrested in Silver Spring. Bennette is being held without bond, while Gladden is awaiting extradition to Maryland. Online court records do not list attorneys for either man.
