      "“From our bench, you could see it going in the whole time,” Stastny said. “Their goalie didn’t see it at all.” The Blues went into the second intermission with that advantage, but added to it after Edmonton’s Mark Fayne was whistled for holding just 3:09 into the third period. The Blues had built a 3-1 lead on a power-play goal by Paul Stastny with 15 minutes, 40 seconds left in regulation, but Edmonton trimmed its deficit to 3-2 with a goal from Taylor Hall with 13:23 to play. Or should we say kneeling? The Blues have torn up Edmonton and so has Tarasenko. His goal Thursday gave him 10 points (six goals, four assists) in 10 career games against the Oilers. But they did it in come-from-behind fashion. With Tarasenko’s left knee touching the ice, he ripped a shot estimated at 55 feet that sizzled past Talbot. A big smile unfolded on Tarasenko’s face, and he pumped his fist, as the Blues built a 2-1 lead with 3:59 left in the second period. Well, the Blues pulled another one out of their hat with the STL Line on the ice. On Tuesday in Calgary, the Flames needed just 1:14 before Mason Raymond put them on the board first. Two days later in Edmonton, the Oilers got one just 1:36 in from Lauri Korpikoski to open the scoring. Lehtera’s line rode into the offensive zone together. The puck went in a direct line from Lehtera to Jaden Schwartz to Troy Brouwer, who put a shot on goalie Cam Talbot. The rebound ricocheted to Talbot’s left, where Lehtera was standing and knocked in the second chance for a 1-1 tie just 3:14 into the period. His teammates knew it was headed for the back of the net. The Blues’ penalty-killing unit kept them in the first period of Tuesday’s game against Calgary, killing off three of the four minors. But the Blues had a quick response, with Jori Lehtera scoring his first goal of the season. “It’s a really important win, especially this home opener,” Blues forward Vladimir Tarasenko said. “It was a huge game for us and we were ready for Edmonton’s compete level. They play way harder right now. I’m really happy to have these two points.” “Yeah, we’re going to do that more and more,” Hitchcock said. “That was a helluva of a line last year. I thought changing it up gave a couple of guys even more energy.” “It’s hard to see the puck, so I just kind of put my stick and skate in the way to redirect it,” Stastny said. “He makes a good heads-up play, it just hits me and goes in.” “I like the fact that we’ve gotten down in games and not really (over) reacted to it, just sort of stayed the course,” Steen said. The NHL’s No. 1 faceoff team going into Thursday’s game had won just 13 of 35 draws before Lehtera and Edmonton’s Mark Letestu dropped into the dot. They battled, the puck popped loose, and an alert Jay Bouwmeester pushed it back to Tarasenko, who was at the top of the circle. The PK was put to work in the second period Thursday against Edmonton, as Colton Parayko and Tarasenko were whistled for back-to-back penalties. When Tarasenko exited the box, the unit was three for three against the Oilers, and a short time later, Tarasenko made amends. “That’s a nice goal to get toward the end of the game,” Steen said. “It was a momentum builder for us, killing off those penalties and take it the other way. It gave us a little breathing room.” “Good job by my teammates,” Tarasenko said. “Good draw by Jori and nice pass by Bouw.” Set up in the offensive zone, Steen feathered a pass just over the top of the crease and Stastny was standing in perfect position to punch the puck past Talbot for his first of the season and a 3-1 lead. The Blues’ second straight road win, a 4-2 victory, wasn’t wrapped up until Alexander Steen put it away with his second goal of the season with 2 minutes, 9 seconds left in regulation. Hitchcock said the STL Line was reunited by design. Hall cut it to 3-2 when, after a face-off, Parayko failed to corral a loose puck. The Oilers forward zipped past defenseman Carl Gunnarsson and beat Blues goalie Brian Elliott for a 3-2 game. But Elliott finished with 24 saves for his sixth straight win over Edmonton, and the Blues improved to 2-1 on their season-long, six-game road trip, which will continue Friday in Vancouver. The Blues have now won eight straight over Edmonton and, going back to 2009, they are 19-2-1 in their last 22 games, including a sparkling 9-1-1 at Rexall Place in that stretch. In every game this season, the Blues have kept the top line of Tarasenko, Stastny and Steen together. But with 4:02 left and a face-off looming in the offensive zone, Hitchcock sent out the “STL Line” of Schwartz, Lehtera and Tarasenko, who were magical at times last year. The Blues put themselves in the penalty box twice in the last 10:42 of the game — Robert Bortuzzo for holding and Scottie Upshall for tripping — giving the Oilers chances. But after the Blues erased both penalties, Steen scored and the visitors held on, albeit with a much harder effort than they’ve needed in the past. The Blues have now played four games in 2015-16 and trailed 1-0 in each. Introducing No. 1 overall pick Connor McDavid to the locals for the first time, and playing in their new orange sweaters, the winless Oilers gave the visitors a rare fit. \n",
